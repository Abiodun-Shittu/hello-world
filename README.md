# hello-world

my first repository

I'm Abiodun, which you already know. I love playing basketball, listening to musics and reading. I started my reading on programming language thinking to just gain some knowledge on JavaScript but as i go deeper, i started having some interest in becoming a software developer. I said to myself that it ain't gonna be easy but my interest grew more and for such it was challenging along the line, but here i am creating my first repository on Github.
